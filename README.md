# 12V-UPS
This project is my school project. It supplys power to security cameras, DVR, router, access-point, ONT and optical CATV receiver.
It can provides directly 1-50V DC without inverting to 240V AC, this minimizes losses and prolongs time on battery, also enable the option to power it from an additional DC source e.g. fotovoltaic system.
