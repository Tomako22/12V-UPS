# 12V-UPS
This project is my school project. It delivers power to security cameras, DVR, router, access-point, optical network terminal and optical CATV receiver.
It provides directly 1-50V DC without inverting to 240V AC, this minimizes losses and prolongs time on battery, also enable the option to power it from an additional DC fotovoltaic system.
